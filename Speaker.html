      <h5>Designing a Culture of Design</h5>

      <p>Workplace culture does not begin with beanbags, foosball tables, or a beer fridge, nor does it conclude with neckties, computers, or large enterprises. It is the unwritten norms, behavior, attitudes, and motives that either allow good work to be done or strangle a team. To be most effective and for designers to feel respected, we must work in a culture that welcomes and allows design to thrive.</p>

      <p>In Krishnan Naganathan's talk, he will discuss how to identify the characteristics of design-driven businesses, both large and small. He'll discuss what certain teams, departments, and corporations have that others don't, as well as how to start changing your own workplace culture. Once you've worked in a design culture, it's often impossible to see oneself elsewhere.</p>

      <h5>About Krishnan Naganathan</h5>

      <p>Krishnan Naganathan is a Senior Product Designer at Nasdaq OMX, a fan of heavy metal, a foodie, and a BBQ expert. Some of his thoughts and talks on the debate surrounding design are available at discussingdesign.com.</p>

      <h5>Lights! Camera! Interaction! Design Inspiration from Filmmakers</h5>

      <p>Films succeed in eliciting responses and engaging audiences only when they combine a well-written narrative with effective storytelling techniques. It is the filmmaker's responsibility to put this together. To accomplish this, they devised strategies, tools, and techniques that allow them to focus attention, underline information, foreshadow, and create the numerous pieces that make up a well-told story.</p>

      <p>In this class, we will address the concept of leveraging tales in design and delve deeper into the technical components of cinematic communication. We'll look at filmmaking techniques like cinematic patterns, beat sheets, and storyboards. We will analyze why they were chosen and how we may draw inspiration from them.</p>

      <h5>About Ram Rastogi</h5>

      <p>Ram Rastogi is a designer, illustrator, and speaker who values teamwork, communication, creativity, and storytelling. Adam, MadPow's Experience Design Director, combines over ten years of experience in interface and experience design with a background in computer science, film, and animation to build successful and user-friendly digital products and services. He believes that no matter how useful a tool is, there is a story behind its construction that must be discovered in order for it to be successful. He occasionally provides his viewpoint on design at discussingdesign.com.</p>
